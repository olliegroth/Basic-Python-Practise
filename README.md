## About The Project

A collection of small python tasks, with the intention of testing and developing my programming skills. This repo was mainly worked upon during the end of my GCSE's and the start of my A-Level study.

A personal favourite of mine is the "AFK-Mouse.py" project; a simple script which moves your mouse arbitrarily around the screen to mimic an active user.
